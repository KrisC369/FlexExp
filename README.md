FlexExp
=======

This repository contains source files for experiments and demos using the Flexsim platform.
This project has a high turnover rate and is therefore not as well documented or tested. 
More longlived elements of this project will be migrated to the main project repository with appropriate testing and documentation when the time comes.

Examples on how to use the simulation project [Flexsim](https://github.com/KrisC369/Flexsim) can be found in the package be.kuleuven.cs.flexsim.example
